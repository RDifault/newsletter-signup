## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
I'm proud to have completed this project using my current skills in React and Tailwind. I've finally put a good use of useRef in this project for email validation and have understood the core concept of it. The project is made to be as similar as possible with the design and responsive with any devices

Since this is the second times i tried using gridboxes, i still haven't able to figure out how to adjust the items inside grid areas, since grids cannot use align-items and justify-content. So currently i'm researching to find a solution to it. The problem can be seen in the Thanks For Subscribing page in mobile version
